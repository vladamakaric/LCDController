Description of a digital system in VHDL which controls a LCD display to display animated 'running' text. 

The system consists of a single CPU with a 4 cycle non-pipelined datapath, a instruction ROM and a general data RAM.
The CPU has 8 registers and a simple instruction set defined so that it could execute general purpose code, but 
the control code for the memory mapped LCD device is hardcoded in the ROM. The project was synthesized to the E2LP board http://www.rt-rk.com/news/142-embedded-engineering-learning-platform

This was a project i did for the digital logic desing course at my university for special credit.
